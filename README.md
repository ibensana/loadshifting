This repository contains a framework for the simulation of electrical and thermal demands of Belgian households.  
So far two models are being used:
- [StRoBe](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe)  
    For modelling the occupancy, use of appliances, lighting, internal heat gains and domestic hot water redrawals.
- [RAMP-mobility](https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP-mobility)  
    For the modelling of the EV charging.  

Alongside the models, some elements are directly included within the framework. It is the case of the thermal building model, the HP-based heating system and the electric boiler.
